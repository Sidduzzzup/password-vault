# üîê Password Vault

Password Vault is a secure web application for managing your passwords safely. It features a powerful password generator that creates strong, random passwords with customizable length and character types. All your passwords are encrypted using AES-256 encryption before being stored in a MongoDB database. The application includes user authentication with JWT tokens stored in secure HTTP-only cookies. You can easily search through your saved passwords, add new entries, edit existing ones, and copy passwords with an auto-clear feature that clears your clipboard after 15 seconds for security. Built with Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, this modern password manager provides a clean, responsive interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices. Simply create an account, start generating strong passwords, and save them to your encrypted vault.
